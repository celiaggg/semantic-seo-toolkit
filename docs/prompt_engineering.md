### Prompt engineering best practices

- Anchor prompts in realistic decision contexts, not keyword lists
- Encode constraints (latency, scale, integration requirements) explicitly
- Ask for reasoning steps and key entities to surface retrieval signals
- Use consistent system prompts per persona role and expertise
- Log outputs and reasoning paths for analysis and improvement

Examples:
- See `examples/generate_and_test_prompts.py`
