# Semantic SEO Strategy Project

A comprehensive Python framework for implementing Elastic's semantic SEO strategy, transforming websites into semantically optimized knowledge hubs for LLMs and semantic search engines.

## Project Goals

This project implements a complete semantic SEO pipeline that:

- **Transforms websites into machine-understandable knowledge hubs** optimized for LLMs and semantic search
- **Builds ontological and entity-driven information architecture** that accurately represents core topical domains
- **Provides comprehensive, semantically rich content** aligned with user personas, intents, and funnel stages
- **Ensures machine-readable, retrievable, and contextually relevant content** for LLM recommendation and citation
- **Positions organizations as topical authorities** in their key domains

##Architecture Overview

The project is organized into 8 stages that progress from persona research to content optimization:

### Stage 0: Personas & Prompt Engineering
- **persona_builder/**: Create user personas from customer data, sales feedback, community discussions
- **prompt_engineering/**: Generate LLM conversation prompts that simulate real user contexts
- **context_modeling/**: Model decision contexts and use cases for different personas
- **llm_testing/**: Test how LLMs respond to different prompts and track reasoning paths

### Stage 1: Entity & Semantic Analysis
- **entity_extraction/**: Extract entities using spaCy and Google NLP API
- **entity_mapping/**: Build and manage the entity map and relationships
- **semantic_clustering/**: Cluster content into semantic groups
- **entity_disambiguation/**: Ensure correct entity interpretation (e.g., Elasticsearch as vector database)

### Stage 2: Keyword Research
- **keyword_research/**: Traditional keyword extraction from GSC, BigQuery, SEMrush
- **prompt_analysis/**: LLM-based query expansion and persona simulation
- **query_fanout/**: Query expansion and variant generation
- **conversational_query_extraction/**: Extract query elements from conversational prompts

### Stage 3: Classification
- **query_classifier/**: Classify queries by entity, intent, and micro-intent
- **intent_detection/**: Detect user intent and purpose (not just informational/transactional)
- **micro_intent_mapping/**: Map to specific content formats (documentation, tutorial, comparison, etc.)

### Stage 4: Entity Map Expansion
- **entity_expansion/**: Expand entity map based on query data
- **semantic_distance/**: Calculate vector similarity and semantic connections
- **relationship_detection/**: Identify entity relationships and attributes

### Stage 5: Gap Analysis
- **embeddings/**: Generate embeddings for content and queries
- **gap_analysis/**: Identify content gaps using semantic similarity
- **hybrid_search/**: Combine BM25 and vector search for relevance scoring
- **coverage_mapping/**: Map queries against current content structure

### Stage 6: Content Recommendations
- **content_briefs/**: Generate data-driven content briefs
- **competitor_analysis/**: Analyze high-authority sources
- **semantic_optimization/**: Validate content semantic strength
- **rag_optimization/**: Ensure content is optimized for RAG retrieval

### Stage 7: Content Audit
- **content_dilution/**: Identify weak or off-topic content
- **topical_authority/**: Calculate site focus and topical coherence
- **semantic_relevance_scoring/**: Score pages against entity map
